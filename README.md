# üê£Problem
Currently, refugees are a huge problem around the world. Since 1982, the number of refugees registered with the UNHCR has never fallen below 10 million per year. South Korea became the first country in East Asia to enforce the Refugee Act in July 2013, leading to a surge in refugee applications, but the country lacks the human and physical infrastructure to screen refugees, including screening personnel, resulting in protracted procedures such as refugee recognition and appeals. According to UNHCR, South Korea's average refugee recognition rate from 2000 to 2017 was 3.5%, the lowest among OECD countries, meaning that it is very difficult for asylum seekers to obtain refugee recognition. As such, South Korea has an urgent need to address its refugee problem.
